In this project, I implemented a complete digital communication chain in MATLAB. I began by 
sampling and uniformly quantizing an analog message signal, encoding the quantized values 
into pulse sequences, and transmitting them through an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian 
Noise) channel with a controlled SNR. On the receiver side, I performed pulse detection, symbol 
decision, error measurement, and reconstructed the analog waveform from the decoded 
sequence. 
I also evaluated the impact of quantization levels and noise intensity on reconstruction 
accuracy, demonstrating how sampling, quantization, and channel noise jointly affect digital 
transmission quality. Through this work, I gained practical experience with digital modulation 
concepts, noise modeling, gray coding, and end-to-end system simulation.
